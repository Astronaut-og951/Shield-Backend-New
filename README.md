# LEXIA BACKEND!

**This backend has been open sourced for everyone and before i get into deeper things about it, ITS NOT FINISHED!**

I Posted this backend because i want to make more updates and i want you guys to use it maybe

this is my very own first custom backend and i will now share the roadmap, features (ETC...)!

# ROADMAP
* Fix logging in
* Add a login system
* Add an Athena file
* Discord bot support
* Bot-commands /create /account ETC...
* DefaultGame, DefaultEngine, DefaultRuntimeOptions ETC...
* And maybe some more things but for now im focused on main parts of the backend

# FEATURES (IMPLEMENTED)
Note: **It really has nothing ive been sitting here for an hour adding the main routes for it but you can go in lobby yet**
[X] Getting in lobby - 50% idk really it just asks for auth and then yeah you will see :sob:

**Getting in lobby is the only thing it has im pretty sure i cant remember but you can check it yourself**

***Again if you want you can take this backend (People say its skidding but i dont mind) you can fix it and make it for your project***

Many people know me as a skidder from the past because im known for skidding momentum eon and all that but that was in the past im now really good at C# And also im learning JS and backend as you can see by this
