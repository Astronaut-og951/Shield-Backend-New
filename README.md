Welcome to the **Lexia Backend**! This project is open-source and a work in progress. Feel free to explore, contribute, and help improve it.

## 🚀 About This Project

This is my first fully custom backend, and while it is not yet complete, I am actively working on improvements. The main purpose of releasing this backend is to allow others to use it, provide feedback, and contribute to its development.

# Supported Seasons
- None

## 📌 Roadmap

### Upcoming Features & Fixes:

- Tournaments
- Account Creation
- ContentPages - News and all that
- ItemShop's - With Bundles

And lots more

## ✅ Current Features

⚠ **Note:** The backend is still in early development, so functionality is limited.

- **Lobby Access** - lobby is broken needs to be fixed
- **Authentication** *(broken)* - needs to be fixed
- **MongoDB** - Requires nothing more unless you want to mod it and make it better

These are all of our features for now, We will add lots more as days and hours go by.
